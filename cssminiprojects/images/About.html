<h2>Entrees [<a href="Entrees.html"> Entrees </a>]</h2>
<p><b>Here’s a detailed description of two popular entrées (one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian) served
     in this restaurants:</b></p>
<h4>1. Non vegetarian Entree </h4>
<p>
    Hyderabadi Dum Biryani is a culinary masterpiece and a must-try dish in Hyderabad. This royal entrée
     is made using premium-quality basmati rice, layered with marinated meat (usually chicken or mutton)
      cooked in yogurt, ginger, garlic paste, and a blend of aromatic spices such as cardamom, cloves,
       cinnamon, and bay leaves. The dish gets its signature flavor from slow-cooking, or “dum,” 
       where the pot is sealed with dough to trap the steam. The saffron-infused rice is layered alternately
        with the tender, juicy meat, creating a perfect balance of flavors.

</p>
        <h4>
           2. Vegetarian Entrée </h4>
<p>
    Bagara Baingan is a classic vegetarian entrée and a staple of Hyderabadi cuisine. This dish features small,
     tender eggplants cooked in a rich, creamy gravy made with roasted peanuts, sesame seeds, and coconut.
      Tamarind pulp adds a tangy flavor, while a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, and red chili powder
       enhances the dish's depth. The eggplants are slit and stuffed with the spice mixture before being 
       simmered in the gravy, resulting in a perfectly balanced dish with a nutty, tangy, and mildly spiced 
       flavor profile.

    </b></p>
    <h4>
        1. Chocolate Lava Cake
    </h4>
        <p>
            Chocolate Lava Cake is an iconic and indulgent dessert, perfect for any chocolate lover.
             It consists of a small, individual chocolate cake with a molten, gooey center that oozes out 
             when sliced. This dessert is made by baking a rich, dark chocolate batter in a ramekin or mold,
              ensuring the outer edges are cooked to form a solid structure while the inner center remains molten.
               The cake is typically served warm, ensuring that the luxurious molten chocolate floods out with each
                spoonful, creating a satisfying contrast of textures.

            The batter for Chocolate Lava Cake is crafted with premium dark chocolate, butter, eggs, and sugar,
             with a pinch of vanilla extract to enhance its flavor. The key to making the perfect Lava Cake is
              ensuring the center remains liquid while the exterior is firm enough to hold its shape. This is
               achieved through careful timing in the oven, typically baking for just 12-15 minutes at a high
                temperature
    </p>
    <h4>
        2. Creme brulee
    </h4>
    <p>
        Crème Brûlée is a timeless French dessert that combines simplicity with sophistication. This dessert
         consists of a smooth, rich custard base made from heavy cream, sugar, vanilla beans, and egg yolks.
          The custard is slowly baked in individual ramekins in a water bath, ensuring a gentle and even cooking
           process that results in a delicate texture. Once the custard has set and cooled, it is topped with
            a thin layer of sugar, which is then caramelized using a blowtorch or under a broiler to create a crisp,
             golden-brown sugar crust.
